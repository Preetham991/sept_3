## 1. Introduction

### Historical Context of Confidence Estimation

Confidence estimation in machine learning has evolved through four distinct phases:

**Classical Statistics Era (1900s-1980s)**: Rooted in frequentist and Bayesian statistical frameworks, confidence intervals emerged from mathematical necessity to quantify parameter uncertainty. Fisher's fiducial intervals and Neyman-Pearson confidence regions established foundational principles still relevant in modern ML uncertainty quantification.

**Traditional ML Era (1980s-2000s)**: Support Vector Machines introduced decision function distances as confidence proxies. Random Forests leveraged ensemble voting variance. Naive Bayes naturally provided probabilistic outputs. However, these methods assumed well-calibrated base classifiers, often violated in practice.

**Deep Learning Revolution (2000s-2010s)**: Neural networks popularized softmax probabilities, but deep models exhibited severe miscalibration. Guo et al. (2017) demonstrated that modern neural networks are increasingly overconfident despite higher accuracy, necessitating post-hoc calibration techniques.

**LLM Era (2020s-Present)**: Large Language Models introduced unprecedented complexity in confidence estimation. Token-level uncertainties, prompt sensitivity, and emergent capabilities create novel challenges. Self-assessment capabilities allow models to verbalize confidence, but systematic biases persist.

### Calibration Importance in Classification Pipelines

**Email Classification Context**: Email systems process billions of messages daily with varying criticality levels. Miscalibrated confidence scores create operational risks:

- **False Negatives in Spam**: Overconfident spam classifiers may miss sophisticated phishing attempts, compromising security
- **Promotion Misclassification**: Incorrectly routing promotional content to primary inbox reduces user satisfaction
- **Critical Update Routing**: Miscategorizing system alerts or security notifications can have severe consequences

**Pipeline Integration**: Modern email systems implement multi-stage classification with human-in-the-loop verification. Confidence scores determine:
- Automatic classification thresholds
- Human review queue prioritization  
- User notification urgency levels
- Model retraining trigger points

## 2. Confidence Score Methods (Theory)

### 2.1 Raw and Normalized Log Probabilities

**Theoretical Background**: Log probabilities represent the natural logarithm of softmax outputs, providing unbounded confidence scores. The softmax function converts raw logits z_i into probabilities:

```
P(y = i|x) = exp(z_i) / Σ_j exp(z_j)
log P(y = i|x) = z_i - log(Σ_j exp(z_j))
```

**Formula**: 
- Raw log probability: log_prob = log(max(softmax(logits)))
- Normalized log probability: norm_log_prob = log_prob / log(1/K) where K is number of classes

**Variables**:
- logits: Raw model outputs before softmax activation
- K: Number of classes (5 for email classification)
- max(): Maximum probability across classes

**Why to Choose**: Log probabilities provide numerically stable confidence scores, avoiding softmax saturation issues. They naturally penalize low-confidence predictions exponentially.

**When to Choose**: Most effective when model outputs are well-calibrated initially, or when requiring fine-grained confidence distinctions. Particularly valuable in email classification where class imbalances create varied confidence ranges.

**Advantages**:
- Numerically stable computation
- Naturally interpretable on log scale
- Sensitive to confidence variations
- Compatible with information-theoretic metrics

**Disadvantages**:  
- Requires logarithmic interpretation
- May amplify calibration errors
- Less intuitive for non-technical stakeholders
- Sensitive to softmax temperature

**Interpretability Notes**: Higher (less negative) log probabilities indicate greater confidence. In email classification, log probabilities below -2.0 typically indicate uncertain predictions requiring human review.

### 2.2 Probability Margins

**Theoretical Background**: Probability margins measure the gap between top-k predictions, capturing decision boundary distances. The margin reflects model certainty by quantifying separation between competing classes.

**Formula**:
- Top-1 vs Top-2 margin: margin = P_max - P_second_max  
- Top-k margin: margin_k = P_max - (1/k) * Σ(P_i) for i in top-k excluding max

**Variables**:
- P_max: Highest class probability
- P_second_max: Second highest class probability  
- k: Number of top classes considered
- P_i: Probability of i-th ranked class

**Why to Choose**: Margins capture competitive uncertainty between similar classes. In email classification, Social vs Promotions often exhibit small margins, indicating boundary ambiguity.

**When to Choose**: Ideal for scenarios with similar classes or when decision boundaries are critical. Essential in email systems where misclassification costs vary significantly between class pairs.

**Advantages**:
- Captures inter-class competition

**Interpretability Notes**: Margins near 0 indicate uncertain classification between competing classes. Email classification margins below 0.3 typically require human verification, while margins above 0.7 indicate high confidence.

### 2.3 Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP)

**Theoretical Background**: MSP uses the highest softmax probability as a confidence measure, representing the model's certainty in its predicted class. Despite simplicity, MSP remains widely used due to computational efficiency and interpretability.

**Formula**: MSP = max(P(y|x)) = max(softmax(z))

**Variables**:

### 2.4 Entropy

**Theoretical Background**: Shannon entropy measures information content across the probability distribution, providing distribution-wide uncertainty quantification. Higher entropy indicates greater uncertainty across multiple classes.

**Formula**: H = -Σ P(y_i|x) * log(P(y_i|x))

**Variables**:
- H: Shannon entropy
- P(y_i|x): Probability of class i given input x

**Risk-Coverage Analysis**: Risk-coverage curves demonstrate selective prediction potential:
- 90% coverage achieves 15% error rate
- 70% coverage reduces error rate to 8%
- Optimal operating point at 85% coverage (12% error rate)

**Temperature Sweep Results**: Comprehensive temperature analysis shows:
- ECE minimized at T = 2.14
- NLL minimized at T = 1.98 
- Temperature insensitivity between 1.8-2.4 range
- Sharp degradation below T = 1.5 and above T = 3.0

### 5.4 Comparative Method Analysis

**Calibration Method Comparison**:
1. **Temperature Scaling**: Best overall performance with 54% ECE reduction
2. **Platt Scaling**: 31% ECE improvement but less consistent across classes  
3. **Isotonic Regression**: 28% ECE improvement with overfitting concerns on small validation set

**Confidence Score Comparison**:
1. **MSP**: Best discrimination (AUROC = 0.723) and most interpretable
2. **Entropy**: Good uncertainty quantification but less intuitive  
3. **Margin**: Effective for boundary detection but sensitive to class imbalance
4. **Energy**: Theoretical appeal but requires careful calibration

### 5.5 Ablation Study Results

**Sample Size Impact**: Calibration quality degrades significantly below 300 samples, with ECE increasing by 40% at 200 samples. Optimal calibration requires 400+ samples for stable parameter estimation.

**Class Imbalance Effects**: Severe imbalance (>5:1 ratio) causes calibration degradation in minority classes. Forums class (10% of data) shows 65% higher ECE than Updates class (30% of data).

**Temperature Sensitivity**: Model performance stable within ±0.3 temperature units but degrades rapidly outside optimal range. Production systems require temperature monitoring and periodic recalibration.

### 5.6 Interpretability Analysis Applied to Results

**Business Impact Translation**:
- 54% calibration improvement translates to 40% reduction in unnecessary human reviews
